# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
    My name is Vivian Hong (she/her). I've always loved videogames as a child and admired the production of them. I was especially invested in the art side of videogames, forever searching up for concept art and dissecting the story/lore of the game. At first, videogames were just a hobby of mine but as I got older, I was met with that familiar daunting realization I would need to set on a career path soon. At first, I intended to become a history teacher since I love the subject of history in general, but I recently realized "Hey, why not combine my skills in art with one of my favorite passions: videogames." So now I'm trying to double major in Game Design and History. I've been drawing since forever and would like to dabble into the field of 3D animation to replicate my favorite games like Resident Evil: Village, God of War Ragnorak, or even Overwatch. I really like games that're fun to play with friends and have interesting lore/story. 

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)
        I'm a Humanitites major in History, but am trying to double major into Game Design. 

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
    Experience on how to create games in the artistic side of the industry. This includes writing and art. I also wish to create some connections with classmates and instructors. 

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
    Balancing the workload and having to learn how to handle programming... 

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
    In the summer of 2024, I took an intro to C++ programing class.

2. Game development (any engine)
    I don't know if this counts, but I'm experienced in digital art programs like MediBang and Procreate. However, I still want to learn how to use Blender to induldge in 2D/3D animation. 

3. Unity
    N/A

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
    A document detailing the structure of the game's design such as it's UI/UX, programming plan, art plan, etc. 

2. Scope management
     Scope is considered how much work and time it'll take to finish the project. Thus, scope management is the production/management of how to handle completing the game's scope. There are different ways to conduct scope management; one that comes to mind is by indulging in using sprint backlogs to keep track of the team's progress in production. 

3. Iteration
    The practice of creating, critiquing, and changing an idea multiple times until it reaches the creator's satisfaction. An idea may go through multiple iterations, having multiple drafts that may be deleted or changed. Rarely will any idea be solidified for submission on the first iteration. 

4. Object-Oriented programming
    N/A

5. Model-View-Controller architecture
    N/A
